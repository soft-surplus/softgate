Hey!

This is the repository that houses our ongoing efforts to build a nice greeting mechanism and "useful utility" for visitors and softies alike. Basically, this project is the Soft Surplus version of a captive portal. 

In case you don't know what a captive portal is, check this out: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal).
